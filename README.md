# EncryptionProgram
In this repository you will find two file namely Encryption.java and main.java
Run in eclipse
   * step 1: create java project.
   * step 2: create a java package.
   * step 3: put files into project by importing them(or you can manually type it).
   * step 4: click run.
   * step 5: give your commands in the console.

At the heart of Asymmetric Encryption lies a cryptographic algorithm. This algorithm uses a key generation protocol (a kind of mathematical function) to generate a key pair. Both the keys are mathematically connected with each other. This relationship between the keys differs from one algorithm to another.
The algorithm is basically a combination of two functions â€“ encryption function and decryption function. To state the obvious, the encryption function encrypts the data and decryption function decrypts it.
For this encryption program we are going to be utilizing the ASCII table([0-31] are special characters so we are going to use [32-126]) for automatically generating keys.
